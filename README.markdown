Anki Decks
----------

Notes on usage:

Most .anki files get pretty large, so I have the individual pieces required to
recreate them (eg, tsv of data and description of fields and templates), as well
as a tarball the contains the data in a compressed format.

Purpose of each deck:

Kore - vocab from core2k/core6k corpa, sorted by ko2001 index
Subs2srs - native material from anime

RevTK Story Updater
-------------------

Pulls stories from koohii and updates your RtK deck.

Anki Rep Estimator
------------------

be done.
