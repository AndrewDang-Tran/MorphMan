General notes:

* New decks aren't processed until you re-open anki since you're probably still
 setting it up and thus don't want MorphMan tying it up until it's ready

* MorphMan can be stopped/restarted via the MorphMan gui. This is useful in case
 it's in the middle of updating a deck you want to use and your computer is slow
