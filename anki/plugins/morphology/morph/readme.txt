General notes:

* New decks aren't processed until you re-open anki since you're probably still
 setting it up and thus don't want Morph Man tying it up until it's ready

* Morph Man can be stopped/restarted via the MorphMan gui. This is useful in case
 it's in the middle of updating a deck you want to use and your computer is slow

* By default Morph Man does it's checks every few seconds and logs to a file. If you
 use battery powered laptop you may want to disable logging (change NO_LOG to True
 in util.py
